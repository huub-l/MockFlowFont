# MockFlowFont - A Font built for Mockups

We created a new font-family set called "MockFlowFont" for wireframes created with our tool at [mockflow.com](https://mockflow.com) and decided to opensource so it can be also used in other apps and prototypes.

"MockFlowFont" helps to quickly create dummy textual content to emphasize the design part of the mockups rather than the text. Unlike other similar fonts, "MockFlowFont" is crafted from scratch with the right font metrics to specifically look good in mockups. 

It comes with two styles:

## "MockFlowFont1" - Mockup style that shows words with spaces

## "MockFlowFont2" - Cleaner Mockup style that only shows sentences

**NOTE:** The above mockups were created using [MockFlow.com](https://mockflow.com) Wireframe Software

## Usage

(1) If you use MockFlow.com to create wireframes, then fonts are already available there as part of its font settings

(2) For web font, make use of the styles.css present in the dist folder

(3) To be used as a Desktop Font in your OS, install the \*.ttf font file from the same folder
